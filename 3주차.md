## Python: Creationg Funcions

- Built-in functions : int, float, print, input, type, sum, ect..
- Now we learn how to build your own custom functions, peroming specific tasks.
- A funcion stats with the keyword def, which is followed by its name starring sith a lowercase letter.
  You may yse underscores tp sperate words in name, say, circle_area_circum. It is recommended to put a docstring, explaining the purpose of a function, righr below the definition of a function.
- At the end we learn random number generation adn i,portinf liberies.

__1. Creating your own functios wigh a single parameter__
```
#Calculating the area and circumgerence of a circle
import math # importing math module of Python for using pi

def circle(radius):# defining a function called circle
    """Calculates area and circumgerence of a circle with a radius""" 
    return math.pi*radius**2,2*math.pi*radius
```

```
#calling a guncion and offering a radius value
circle(3)
```
(28.274333882308138, 18.84955592153876)
```
#Function calls can be embedded
x=3
print(f"The area and circumgerence of a circle with {x}cm radius \
are {circle(x)[0]:.2f}cm squared and {circle(x)[1]:.2f}cm.")
```
The area and circumgerence of a circle with 3cm radius are 28.27cm squared and 18.85cm.
```
# Looking up a funcion's docstirng/ 물음표 붙이면 된다.
circle?
```
