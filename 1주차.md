## Python Basics
<KOOC의 인공지능 코딩을 위한 실용 파이썬> 강의을 바탕으로 씀.


__1. correct indentation and strings__
 - Strings are used for storing and representing text data.

```
print('This kooc is an excellent course')
print("Course name \nis Practical Python")
print("Those who don't take this Kooc would regret their decisions")
```

(Exercise 1) Move the second print by two blank spaces to the right. See and explain what happens.

__2. Integrs, floats and decimals : using Python as a calculator.__

- Variable names are identifiers, so they follow the rules of identifier.
- Variables store values such as strings, numbers, and other data types.
- Use a hash, #, to write memos in a line.

#addition: use a hash(#) sign, you can write memos.

```
23+17
```

40


```
2/3
```

0.66666666666666


__3. Data types and simple use of print function__

```
#Addition
y=5
z=7.5 # assign a value to the variable y.
print("y+z=",y+z)
type(y)
type(z)
```

y+z= 12.5
float

#바로 위에서 y의 타입이 결과값에 도출 되지 않음. y도 알고 싶을 경우 print(type(y))사용.
#근데 저렇게 쓰면 왜 y가 안나오냐: 주피터랩 룰임.

__4. String, Boolean, and triple quoted strings__

- Boolean expression
- """are used to write multiple line strings""".
- Is also uesd fot docstings.

```
print(7>3)
print(3>7)
x = 7>3
print(type(x),x)
```
True
False
<class 'bool'> True

```
"""Triple quoted strings are used to wrtied multiple line strings.
This is an evample of a doc sitrng"""
```
'Triple quoted strings are used to wrtied multiple line strings.\nThis is an evample of a doc sitrng'

__5. Taking input values__

```
your_name = input("What is your name?")
print(your_name)
```
What is your name? kelly
kelly

```
your_age = input("How old are you?")
print(your_age, type(your_age))
```
How old are you? 21
21 <class 'str'>

```
#Turning string value to intger
print(int(your_age)+ int(20))
```
41

__6. If clause and comparison poerators__

[Comparison operators]
- x > y : x is greater than y
- x < y : x is less than y
- x >= y : x is greater than or equal to y
- x,= y : x is less than or equal to y
- x == y : x is equal to y
- x!= y : x is not equal to y

[If clause]

- if : performs an action if a xondition is met (True)and no action if not.
- if ... else: sname as above and returns alternative if not.

```
x= int(input("Enter an integer")) #Taking an integer

if x ==1: # if-clause
    print("x has a value of 1")
else:
    print("x does nor have a value of 1")
```

Enter an integer 1
x has a value of 1

```
var1= int(input("Enter the first integer"))
if var1<0:
    print("The first integer is",var1, "and its value is negative")
    
var2= int(input("Enter the second integer"))
if var2 < 0:
    print("The second integer is negative", "and its value is", var2)
else:
    print("The second integer is positve", "and its value is",var2)
```
Enter the first integer -2
The first integer is -2 and its value is negative
Enter the second integer 2
The second integer is positve and its value is 2

__7. Dynamic value assignment and type changing__

- What happens if you assign diggerent values for the same variable?

```
print(x,type(x))
x=2.5
print(x, type(x))

x="Arnold"
print(x,type(x))
```
1 <class 'int'>
2.5 <class 'float'>
Arnold <class 'str'>

__8. Multiple statements on a single line__

- Separate two command lines with semicolon

```
print("Hello!"); print("This is KOOC content \n for Python basics")
```
Hello!
This is KOOC content 
 for Python basics
